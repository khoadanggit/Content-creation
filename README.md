# Content-creation
n8n workflow that streamlines content creation by combining research, writing, and visual generation into a single pipeline. All the user need to input is the topic and target audience.

The process starts with Tavily Search, which ensures that the content is grounded in accurate, up-to-date, and credible sources—minimizing the risk of hallucinations from LLMs. Based on the retrieved information, the workflow then generates a well-written post and pairs it with a custom AI-generated illustration, perfectly tailored to the topic.

This approach not only saves time but also maintains a high standard of quality and reliability.

Applications:
This kind of workflow is especially valuable for content creators across multiple domains—whether you're in marketing, education, journalism, technical writing, or even social media management. By automating the research and creative process, it enables faster, more consistent content production without compromising accuracy or creativity.
